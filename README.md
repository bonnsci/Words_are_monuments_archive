Link to paper:

The data are the place names from 16 US national parks, their origins and sources, and classifications according to the decision trees (Figs. S1-S3). When sources are listed as AUTHOR YEAR in the data they refer to the books listed in Table S2. In the data and code early names for columns and classes were changed for clarity and accuracy in the publication as follows: the column “Problem” in the data and code is “Dimensions of Racism and Colonialism” in the paper; the “Problem” class “Western Use” in the data and code is “Appropriation” in the paper; the “Erasure” class “Erasure – yes” is “Replacement” in the paper.
